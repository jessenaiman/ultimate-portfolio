Research: how daisyui and tailwindcss as well as astrojs handle ui accept solutions that are following these. You can use context7, the mcp documentation tools, or @web https://daisyui.com/llms.txt

Fix the following issues while making sure to not break the design of any other page. You can make a framework-layout that inherits from the @BaseLayout.astro

The following pages need to have a unified and professional look:
- `@src/pages/svelte-framework.astro`
- `@src/pages/solid-framework.astro`
- `@src/pages/react-framework.astro`
- `@src/pages/vue-framework.astro`

**Note:** The `@src/pages/react-framework.astro` page is the closest to the desired design, but has too much vertical spacing between components. This page should only be refactored once another framework page has successfully implemented one of the fixes below.

These are the current major issues:

| Progress | Task | File(s) | Context | Suggested Fixes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [x] Complete | 1. Create the `FrameworkLayout.astro` file. | `@src/layouts/FrameworkLayout.astro` | A dedicated layout for the framework pages is needed to ensure a consistent look and feel. | Created a new layout file at `@src/layouts/FrameworkLayout.astro` that inherits from `@src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` with a responsive design compatible with the overall site design. |
| [x] Complete | 2. Unify the hero design in the `FrameworkLayout.astro` file. | `@src/layouts/FrameworkLayout.astro` | The framework pages have duplicate and inconsistent hero blocks. The new layout file will solve this by providing a single, theme-aware hero component with a slot for page-specific content. | Defined a hero block in the `FrameworkLayout.astro` file with slots for icons, actions, and content. The hero uses DaisyUI's hero component with responsive design for all screen sizes. |
| [x] Complete | 3. Implement the "Learn more about..." section in the new layout file. | `@src/layouts/FrameworkLayout.astro` | Each framework page has a "Learn more about..." section. This should be handled within the new layout file to ensure consistency. | Added a collapsible section using DaisyUI's collapse component with a customizable title and a slot for markdown content. |
| [x] Complete | 4. Fix missing icons on the Vue framework page. | `@src/pages/vue-framework.astro` | The Vue framework page is missing icons that are present on the other framework pages. | Added the `astro-icon` package import and included Vue logo icons in the hero section. |
| [x] Complete | 5. Improve visual separation and responsiveness of demo components. | `@src/pages/react-framework.astro`, `@src/pages/solid-framework.astro`, `@src/pages/svelte-framework.astro`, `@src/pages/vue-framework.astro` | The demo components need better visual separation. On wider screens, more than one demo should appear side-by-side. | Implemented a responsive grid layout that displays demos in a single column on mobile and two columns on larger screens, with appropriate spacing. |
| [x] Complete | 6. Unify the component and code design into a single component. | `@src/components/ui/DemoCard.astro` | The component and code design should be unified into the `@src/components/ui/DemoCard.astro` component. | Refactored the `DemoCard` component to include both the demo and the code in a tabbed interface. The new component uses DaisyUI tabs to switch between the live demo and the source code. |
| [x] Complete | 7. Ensure the component rendered in the Demo Card space fills the available space. | `@src/components/ui/DemoCard.astro` | The component rendered in the Demo Card space should fill the entire area, avoiding the nested block appearance. | Removed unnecessary padding and margins from the `DemoCard` component and its slots. The component now fills the available space, providing a cleaner look. |
