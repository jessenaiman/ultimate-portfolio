With nearly two decades of experience in web development, I have navigated an ever-evolving technological landscape, consistently adapting and innovating where many have stagnated. My expertise spans the foundational days of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, and ASP.NET, connecting seamlessly to modern AI and blockchain technologies. I specialise in creating efficient, scalable, and future-proof solutions to complex problems

My career highlights include significant achievements such as implementing Test-Driven Design (TDD) at Resolver, where I also introduced a jQuery solution that reduced an overtime initiative by approximately 30% through automation and refactoring
At the Ontario Liberal Party, I led a system-wide upgrade from a rigid VB.NET system to a flexible OAuth API using MongoDB and Ruby on Rails. During critical election periods, I successfully managed hundreds of websites, demonstrating resilience and adaptability

To showcase my current capabilities and proficiency in cutting-edge tools, I have developed two key projects:

• Future Stack: This project is a comprehensive demonstration of modern frameworks, including Svelte, Vue, React, SolidJS, and Remix. It features advanced integrations such as image generation, ChatGPT, and Blockchain AI, alongside dynamic components and an interactive resume. It stands as proof of my ability to blend diverse technologies into seamless, responsive, accessible, and highly optimised solutions

• Dice Wizard Games: An e-commerce platform built with Astro.js, TailwindCSS, and View Transitions, this project exemplifies my commitment to responsive design, performance optimisation, and user-centric UX principles

I am passionate about exploring new technologies and developing innovative solutions. My GitHub accounts, @ontariodungeons and @jessenaiman, contain various projects that reflect this enthusiasm

I am eager to discuss how my extensive experience and proven track record in full-stack development, technical leadership, and problem-solving can directly contribute to your team's success.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
