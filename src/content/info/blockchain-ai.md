## About This Integration
This demonstration showcases how blockchain technology can be leveraged to create decentralized AI applications. The chat interface is powered by Akash, a decentralized cloud computing marketplace.

### Key features:
- Decentralized AI processing
- Blockchain-based verification
- Transparent token economics
- Privacy-preserving computation

## How It Works
When you interact with the chat interface, your queries are processed through a network of decentralized compute providers on the Akash network. This ensures that no single entity has control over the AI model or your data, providing greater privacy and censorship resistance.

## Technical Implementation
The integration uses React for the frontend interface and connects to blockchain nodes via Web3.js. The AI models are deployed on Akash containers and accessed through secure API endpoints.
