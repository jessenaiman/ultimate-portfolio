I have also used these technologies in a few personal projects, such as a website for a local community group and a personal blog. I have found that these technologies are very powerful and have helped me build scalable and performant applications. I am comfortable with the advanced concepts and potential edge cases of these technologies and have continuously improved my skills by working on real-world projects.
4. I have used ChatGPT to generate code snippets, write documentation, and answer questions.

I am comfortable with the ethical considerations surrounding the use of AI in development and always ensure that I use AI responsibly.
5. I approach integrating new and old technologies by evaluating the requirements of the project and choosing the best tools for the job.

I have overcome these challenges by leveraging my technical expertise, communication skills, and problem-solving abilities.
