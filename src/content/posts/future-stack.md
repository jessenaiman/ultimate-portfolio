## Bridging Two Decades of Development with the Cutting Edge

Hi, I'm Jesse – a developer who thrives on the dynamic interplay between robust, time-tested practices and the exhilarating possibilities of emerging technologies. With nearly twenty years of experience building software solutions, I bring a unique perspective that bridges the gap between the familiar and the cutting edge.

**From Enterprise-Level to Open Source, I've Done It All**

My journey spans diverse projects, from architecting career recruitment platforms and streamlining healthcare systems to managing the online presence of major political parties and diving deep into the world of Web3.  This breadth of experience has instilled in me a "best tool for the job" philosophy, allowing me to seamlessly integrate the most effective technologies, whether it's a time-tested framework like Ruby on Rails or a bleeding-edge library like Astro or SolidJS.

**The AI Revolution: More Than Just a Buzzword**

While I've harnessed the power of cloud-based AI APIs from leading providers like Google and OpenAI, I'm particularly intrigued by the potential of local AI to revolutionize development workflows and deliver substantial cost savings. Imagine running powerful language models like LLaMa or Gemini directly on your infrastructure – that's the future I'm excited to help build.

**Beyond the Code: Building Communities and Navigating Blockchains**

My experience extends beyond pure development. As a community leader within the Solana ecosystem, I provided technical support and fostered engagement for thousands of users, becoming fluent in the language of blockchain technology and decentralized applications.

**Let's Connect**
