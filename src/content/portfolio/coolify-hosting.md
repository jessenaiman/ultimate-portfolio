# Coolify Self-Hosted Platform

Coolify is an open-source, self-hosted Heroku/Netlify alternative that I've deployed and configured to host various web applications and services. This platform allows me to maintain complete control over my infrastructure while providing modern deployment workflows.

## Key Features

- **One-Click Deployments**: Automatic deployments from Git repositories
- **Container Management**: Docker-based infrastructure for isolated environments
- **Database Services**: Managed PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Redis instances
- **SSL Management**: Automatic SSL certificate generation and renewal
- **Monitoring**: Built-in resource monitoring and logging

## Technical Implementation

The Coolify instance is running on a dedicated VPS with proper security hardening, including:

- Reverse proxy configuration with Traefik
- Automated backups to secure storage
- Custom domain management
- Resource allocation optimization

This portfolio site itself is hosted on this Coolify instance, demonstrating the platform's capabilities for modern web application hosting.
