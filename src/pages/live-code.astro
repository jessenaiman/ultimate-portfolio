      <h2>About This Component</h2>
      <p>
        The Live Code Editor is built using SolidJS and integrated into Astro using the <code>client:load</code> directive.
        This ensures that the component is fully interactive as soon as the page loads.
      </p>
      <p>
        Key features:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Syntax highlighting for multiple languages</li>
        <li>Real-time preview for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
        <li>Responsive design with adjustable panels</li>
        <li>Built with SolidJS for optimal performance</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        The editor uses SolidJS's reactive primitives to maintain state and update the preview in real-time.
        When you type in the editor, the changes are immediately reflected in the preview panel without requiring
        a full page reload or explicit save action.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
      <p>
        The component leverages Monaco Editor for the code editing experience and uses a sandboxed iframe
        for the preview to ensure security. The integration with Astro demonstrates how SolidJS components
        can be seamlessly incorporated into an Astro project.
