## Future Enhancements & Ideas

This file tracks potential improvements for the portfolio website.

### Visual Enhancements

- **Tab Transition Effect**: Implement a more dynamic transition for the tabs. The [DaisyUI Stack component](https://daisyui.com/components/stack/) could be used to create a card-swap or flip effect, making the content feel more interactive as it's pulled from "underneath."

### General Improvements

- **Accessibility Review**: Conduct a thorough accessibility audit of the site. Ensure all components, especially interactive ones like the tabs and theme controller, have the necessary ARIA attributes and are fully navigable via keyboard.
- **Performance Optimization**: Review image sizes and loading strategies to ensure the page remains fast and responsive, especially as more content is added.
- **Contact Form**: Consider replacing the `mailto:` links with a functional contact form using a service like Formspree or a custom backend endpoint. This can improve user experience and reduce spam.
